# Avatar assets

The SVG illustrations stored in `assets/avatars/` were custom-created for this project. They may be used within the Allergy Wheel
experience under the same license that governs the rest of the repository. Please reach out to the maintainers before reusing the
artwork in other projects if the repository license does not cover your intended use.

## Available avatars

The game currently includes the following six selectable avatars:

- Sunny Girl
- Curious Girl
- Adventurous Boy
- Creative Boy
- T-Rex
- Triceratops

## Contributing new avatars

- Submit only artwork that you created yourself or that you have explicit permission to redistribute with attribution details.
- Provide vector SVG files optimized for the web (remove unnecessary metadata and keep file sizes low).
- Include a note in your pull request describing the source of the artwork and the licensing terms.
- Update any relevant constants, tests, and documentation so the new avatar appears in the selector UI and remains fully covered
  by automated checks.

## Attribution

- The 2024 T-Rex and Triceratops dinosaur avatars were created specifically for the Allergy Wheel project and are available
  under the same repository license. No external artwork or additional attribution is required.
